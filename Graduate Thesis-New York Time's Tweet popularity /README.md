# Graduate thesis
## Thesis abstract:
With the rapid development of social network platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Weibo, online social media is transforming the traditional news industry as they act as crucial sources of information. Moreover, the influence is exponentially expanded by functions like “retweet” by which individuals can pass along information to one another. Facing this challenge, how can big news agencies like New York Times react in order to produce popular news and attract the largest amount of audience? In the paper, we focus on the content of the news itself and suggest that a better performance of news agencies on online social media can be achieved partly by adjusting the news content. We utilize the scraped information of New York Times’ tweets and try to analyze the relationship between content features (length, hashtag, simplicity, sentiment, terms, named entities) and popularity of the tweets (which can be indicated by number of retweets/likes). This study then applies machine learning methods to build the prediction model.
## Thesis conclusion:
content-based features (length, hashtag, mentions, named entities, sentiment, simplicity, readability and TF-IDF of terms) have essential predictive value for classifying popular tweets and unpopular tweets if the classification barrier is set to be retweet count = 100 and favorite count = 200. 
It is also noted that overall “TF-IDF of terms” performs better than other content-based features, which reveals that specific words may catch audience attention and influence the popularity of the news in a larger extent than the other index calculated in this paper (like sentiment, simplicity, readability).
